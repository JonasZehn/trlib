Installation
============

Dependencies
------------

You have to make sure that the following requirements are provided:

    - BLAS
    - LAPACK
    - CMake

The following dependencies are optional:

    - for the unittests:
        - Check
    - for the documentation:
        - sphinx with read the docs theme
        - numpydoc
    - for the python interface:
        - Python Header, TRLIB works with Python 2 and 3 and compiles for the versions it finds
        - Cython
        - NumPy
        - SciPy
    - for the matlab interface:
        - MATLAB with mex compiler and header files

Ubuntu/Debian Packages
----------------------

To install all dependencies in a Ubuntu/Debian environment:

If you want to use Python 3::

    sudo apt-get install cmake check build-essential python3-dev python3-numpy python3-scipy cython3 liblapack-dev libblas-dev python3-sphinx python3-sphinx-rtd-theme

If you want to use Python 2::

    sudo apt-get install cmake check cython build-essential python-dev python-numpy python-scipy cython liblapack-dev libblas-dev python-sphinx python-sphinx-rtd-theme

Compilation
-----------

TRLIB is set up to create out of source builds using CMake. First create a build directory and change to that:

    mkdir build
    cd build

Set up CMake in this directory::

    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

Instead of ``Release`` you may also choose ``Debug`` which disables compiler optimization and enables debugging.

You may want change settings as described below in CMake, especially you have to turn on compilation of the python/matlab interface if you wish. After that execute::

    ccmake .

Press ``c`` to reconfigure with changes and ``q`` to exit.

You can now compile TRLIB, generate the documentation and run the tests by executing::

    make
    make test
    make doc
    make install

Depending on the installation location, you might have to execute ``make install`` as super user::

    sudo make install
